				<p>
					This is my very first try to make an api, using SDL/C++. This api is strictly targeted for game gui. It does not have a lot of features yet, and even some of the basic features are missing, I look forward to add them in the future updates. If you want to see the source code or if you want to contribute to the project. You are most likely welcome also I thank you for checking it out. The zip file 
					contains the source codes and a sample main file that if you run, will create a program that will have label, an input field and a button. Please note that you must have a knowledge of SDL to use this api.

				<h3>Cross - Circle Game</h3> <!-- title -->
				<h5 class="underline">Introduction</h5>
				<!-- description -->
				<p>
				This game is just tic-tac-toe, I named it Cross - Circle because when I was making it, I didn't research. However, the game is pretty simple, I didn't use SDL_ttf library in it, because<br>
				it's .dll file is just to big that when I compress it, it will become around 12MB game, where as all my assets except for .dll files should be around 800kb size. So there is no score system, <br>
				there is just a button, then there is 'x' or 'o' turn text and the 'x' wins or 'o' wins. I guess the audio files took most of the space / storage for the game. The images are hand-drawing in MSpaint<br>
				and the audio is recorded or created using <a href="https://sfxr.me/" target="_blank">https://sfxr.me/</a> and the original sxfr tool on this site <a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html</a><br>

								<li>The game is pretty simple.</li>
								<li>The game does not crash on exit (on my computer at least).</li>
								<li>The game is only under 3MB in size. (I guess I have to distribute a seperate zip file without the .dll files in it)</li>
								<li>It also contains source files, so you can tweak here and there if you have knowledge of SDL/C++</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
						<!-- cons -->
						<td>
							<ul>
								<li>The game may be boring overtime.</li>
								<li>There are handful of bugs that I didn't bother to fix cause, the major bugs took most of my brain juice.</li>
								<li>There is no system for score, it's just plain game.</li>
								<li>There is no menu or anything, just straight into the game.</li>
								<li>My voice over is pretty darn grim. You can change it just copy a file into the 'audio' directory and name it 'circleWins.mp3' or 'crossWins.mp3'.</li>
